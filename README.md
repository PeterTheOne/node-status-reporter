# ARTIS node status reporter

This application is intended to run alongside an ARTIS node (Parity) and continuously reports the status of that node to a configurable instance of the [eth-netstats](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-netstats) application, which creates a nice, but incomplete, visualization of the network (example: http://status.tau1.artis.network/).

The application was written for Ethereum and originally named "Ethereum Network Intelligence API".  
For more information, take a look at the origin: https://github.com/cubedro/eth-net-intelligence-api/ (be aware that it hasn't been updated in a while).
