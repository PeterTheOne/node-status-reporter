# Ethereum node status reporter

This application is intended to run alongside an Ethereum/ARTIS node (e.g. Parity) and continuously reports the status of that node to a configurable instance of the [eth-netstats](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-netstats) application, which creates a nice, but incomplete, visualization of the network (example: http://status.tau1.artis.network/).

For more information, take a look at https://github.com/cubedro/eth-net-intelligence-api/ (be aware that it hasn't been updated in a while).
